- You want to know the density of fish in a set of
experimental ponds:
  - You observe the following counts in ten ponds:
5,6,7,3,6,5,8,4,4,3

- What is your process model?

My process model is $f(x) = fish\ density$

- What is your data model?

I thought that the poission distribution would be a good fit, because it's sampleing in a fixed space. 

$$P(y| \lambda) = e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{y}$$
Becuase I have mulitple data points: 
$$P(y_i| \lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}\ \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{y_i}}{y_i!}$$

- Solve for the analytical MLE

$$ln(f(y_i)) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\ ln(\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{y_i}}{y_i!})$$
$$ln(f(y_i)) =  -\lambda n + (\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i) ln(\lambda) - (\sum_{i=1}^{n}ln(y_i!))$$

Taking the deriviative:
$$\frac{d}{d\lambda}(ln(f(y))) = -n+(\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i)\frac{1}{\lambda}$$
$$0 = -n+(\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i)*\frac{1}{\lambda}$$
$$\lambda = (\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i)*\frac{1}{n}$$
Aka the mean!

- What is the estimate for this population?


```{r, echo=TRUE}
obs<-c(5,6,7,3,6,5,8,4,4,3)
mean(obs)

```
My estimate is 5.1 fish per pond.
